              What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and
              where should we store them on the client-side?
            </b>{" "}
            â€”/-=== Access Token: An access token is a credential that is issued
            by an authentication server to a client application after a user
            successfully authenticates. It is a string of characters that
            represents the authorization granted to the client application to
            access protected resources on behalf of the authenticated user.
            Access tokens typically have a limited lifespan and expire after a
            certain period of time.

            <b>Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?</b> === NoSQL databases excel at
            horizontal scalability, allowing them to handle large volumes of
            data by distributing it across multiple servers in a cluster. They
            can easily scale out to accommodate increased data and traffic. SQL
            databases enforce data integrity rules, such as primary key
            constraints and referential integrity, which ensure the consistency
            and reliability of the data.

            <b>What is express js? What is Nest JS?</b> ==== Express is a node
            js web application framework that provides broad features for
            building web and mobile applications. It is used to build a single
            page, multipage, and hybrid web application. NestJS embraces the
            concept of dependency injection, making it easy to manage and inject
            dependencies throughout your application. It helps you write
            modular, testable, and extensible code by decoupling components and
            promoting loose coupling.

            <b>What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work?</b>In MongoDB,
            the aggregate function is a powerful tool used for performing
            advanced data processing and analysis on collections of documents.
            It allows you to perform complex operations, transformations, and
            aggregations on the data stored in a MongoDB collection.
